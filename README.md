# Bilibili-AutoDanmaku B站录播自动添加弹幕

[简体中文 README | Simplified Chinese](docs/README_CN.md)

This is a personal project made solely for the purpose of interoperating with [BililliveRecorder](https://github.com/Bililive/BililiveRecorder).

BililiveRecorder usually produces several flv  videos and xml danmaku in livestream recordings. This `python` program automatically takes these files as input and renders video file(s) that contain live danmaku comments.
