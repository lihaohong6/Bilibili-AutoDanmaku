# Bilibili-AutoSub B站视频自动添加弹幕

This is a personal project made solely for the purpose of interoperating with [BililliveRecorder](https://github.com/Bililive/BililiveRecorder).

BililiveRecorder usually produces several flv  videos and xml danmaku in livestream recordings. This shell script automatically takes these files as input and renders video file(s) that contain live danmaku comments. 

## Install & Use

Make sure you have the following installed:
* `bash` or a compatible shell. 
* `Python 3.9` or above. `Python 2` is not supported and lower versions of `Python 3` may not be supported.
* [BililiveRecorder](https://github.com/Bililive/BililiveRecorder). **NOT** needed if you are sourcing your videos elsewhere. `BililiveRecorder.Cli` is required if you want to automatically merge subtitles from livestreams.
